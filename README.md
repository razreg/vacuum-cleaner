# Vacuum Cleaner Simulator and Algorithms
CS TAU 2016 | Advanced Topics in Programming | C++ Assignments

This is a repository for code submitted for assinments in Tel-Aviv University course Advanced Topics in Programming (0368-3058). 
The instructions for the 4 course assignments can be found under the instructions directory; 
each tag/release corresponds to one of these exercises.
We were asked to create a simulator for a robotic vacuum cleaner where various algorithms will be tested. 
<ol>
  <li>The first exercise focused on implementing the simulator infrastructure and getting to know C++.</li>
  <li>The second assignment aimed at adding concurrency and allowing the simulator to load algorithms as shared objects.</li>
  <li>The third exercise's main concern was creating smarter algorithms, to be run against other students'.</li>
  <li>The fourth and final assignment involved creating a video of the algorithm simulations.</li>
</ol>

All code was written in C++11 for Unix environment (tested on Ubuntu).
